# GASP for Distributed-Matrix-Multiplication

The project has been done by MSc. 1st year students:
- Artem Vasilev
- Mahmud Allahverdiyev

Content:
- literature review on distributed matrix multiplication for secure systems
- implementation and comparison of different matrix multiplication algorithms
- distributed matrix multiplication implementation via mpl library (python)
- GASP codes download ratios implementation (to replicate the result of the main paper)

Notes:
- To run mpi_matmul.py use  the command 'mpirun -np 4 python mpi_matmul.py'.
